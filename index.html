            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>
                I am a PhD Candidate in Information Science at Cornell University and an IvyPlus Scholar
                in the Department of Economics at Stanford University. My research lies at the intersection of economics, behavioral science, and digital platforms.  I study online user behavior and digital market design, with a focus on advertising,
                algorithmic recommendation systems, and data-driven intermediaries.My work combines field experiments, large-scale behavioral data, and theoretical modeling
                to examine how platform design choices affect consumer welfare, market outcomes, and privacy.

                I am currently co-leading the
                <strong>Internet Behavior Experiment (IBE)</strong>,
                a large-scale randomized field experiment designed to study online advertising,
                tracking, and targeting across browsers, email, and mobile devices,
                in collaboration with
                <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/alessandro-acquisti" target="_blank">Alessandro Acquisti</a>,
                <a href="https://ccheyre.github.io/" target="_blank">Cristobal Cheyre</a>,

                I received a BSc and an MSc in Economics and Social Sciences from Bocconi University,
                where I specialized in Behavioral Economics and Industrial Organization. During my masters, I worked on empirical projects in digital markets and ad-tech with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/francescodecarolis/home" target="_blank">
                        Francesco Decarolis</a>. Before starting my PhD, I also worked for Compass Lexecon (London) and Oxera Consulting LLP in Oxford (UK). A detailed overview of my academic background, research, and experience
                is available in my curriculum vitae:
