                My projects study how interface design, data flows, and algorithmic optimization shape attention,
                market outcomes, and consumer welfare, with implications for antitrust, privacy, and platform regulation.

                    <p class="research-authors">

                        This paper studies how the diffusion of large language models (LLMs) as consumer-facing
                        information intermediaries reshapes web traffic allocation and market concentration.
                        Using large-scale behavioral data, we document substitution patterns between traditional
                        search engines, LLM-based interfaces, and downstream content providers. We show that LLM
                        adoption alters referral flows and reduces direct traffic to certain classes of websites,
                        with heterogeneous effects across content categories. These shifts have implications for
                        market power, content sustainability, and the measurement of concentration in digital markets.
                        The results inform ongoing antitrust and platform governance debates around AI-driven intermediaries.

                    <p class="research-authors">
                        with Cristobal Cheyre and Alessandro Acquisti
                    </p>
                    <p class="research-abstract">
                        This project examines how advertising affects consumer search costs, consideration sets,
                        and market outcomes in digital environments. Leveraging a large-scale field experiment with
                        detailed browsing and advertising exposure data, we study how personalized and contextual
                        ads shape information acquisition and navigation behavior. We quantify changes in search
                        intensity, set composition, and downstream purchase decisions across experimental conditions.
                        The analysis sheds light on the dual role of advertising as both an informational device
                        and a potential distortion in consumer decision-making. The findings speak to debates in
                        industrial organization, consumer protection, and digital advertising regulation.

                    <p class="research-authors">
                        Solo-authored
                    </p>
                    <p class="research-abstract">
                        This paper develops a dynamic model of interaction between a profit-maximizing digital
                        platform and users who may be vulnerable to certain categories of content. The platform
                        optimizes engagement through adaptive recommendation algorithms that learn from past user
                        behavior, while users exhibit myopia and limited awareness of long-run utility consequences.
                        We show that engagement-based optimization can lead to a “cursed” equilibrium in which
                        platforms rationally amplify triggering content, generating persistent welfare losses for users.
                        The equilibrium arises even in the absence of malicious intent or informational asymmetries
                        on the platform side. The model provides a theoretical foundation for understanding algorithmic
                        harm and motivates policy interventions beyond standard transparency or disclosure tools.
